# Biodiversity_US_NationalParks

This project purpose is to analyse two datasets, named observations and species_info, provided in a .csv format.

Available data refers to endangered and not endangered species observed in four US National Parks.

The goal is to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

I'm aware the project still have some problems regarding the plotting of the most spotted species at each National Park: colors should always stay the same, which isn't the case.

Happy reading!
